		<h1>hi im dufdufduf123</h1>

		<p>I'm a freshman studying math at the University of Washington at Seattle. I really like math and music and have a vague disinterest in anything I can't somehow tie into either one. Now that you're here, you might want to look at the one thing I have up right now, which is about me messing around with the <a href="Collatz/collatz.html">Collatz Conjecture</a>.</p>
