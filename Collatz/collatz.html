		<h1>Adventures with the Collatz Conjecture</h1>
	
		<p>I don't remember the first time I heard about the Collatz conjecture, but I remember that I was messing around with it during high school calc when I should've probably be paying attention. For those unfamiliar with the premise of the Collatz conjecture, it basically means that no matter what number $n$ you start at, you will eventually reach 1 if you repeatedly half it for any even $n$, and multiply it by 3 and add 1 for any odd $n$. As a function, this could be written out as:</p>
		<div class="math">$f(x) = \begin{cases}\frac{n}{2} & \text{if n is even} \\
			3n + 1 & \text{if n is odd} \\
			\end{cases}$
		</div>
